#### So, what is Sushi clicker?

Sushi Clicker is an Idle Clicker game app that can run on any device that supports the Android operating system.

We thought a lot during the diploma period about what project we should create.
After many aspects and consultations, we decided to develop a Idle clicker game.
We decided to make the choice of an Idle Clicker game app after we did a small market survey and tested a game that could attract a wide audience and bring pleasure to all ages.
After choosing the type of final project app as Idle Clicker, we debated a number of foods as the main topic of the game. Among the options were sushi, avocado and tacos, and after searching Google and comparing all together, we found that sushi is a much more popular food and therefore the theme of the chosen game is sushi and hence the name of the game Sushi Clicker.
Here you can see a graph describing the level of popularity (according to the number of searches in Google) between the different options and presenting the sushi as the most popular food of the options.

#### And... What is the purpose of the game?

The purpose of the game is to produce sushi and fight for the most efficient production.
During the game, options are given to improve and upgrade the production of sushi, thus allowing the player to produce more sushi with less effort.
We also aspired to the possibility of the player competing with his Facebook friends to aspire to be the best sushi maker among his friends.

#### That's nice. Have you both learned anything new?

During the design and development of the game app, we were asked to learn independently things that were not included in the curriculum such as the C# programming language, game development by using Unity and using the Firebase database, which includes saving and pumping player data in real time, signing up and logging in via Facebook and Google, and more.
